### Previews and thumbnails of [Texture3D](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture3D.html) asset

When importing the Texture3D asset, Unity will automatically render a preview of the Texture3D to display in the Project window.

### Acknowledgment

The sample Texture3D asset provided with this package was made using [MRI scans found on this website](https://neil.fraser.name/news/2007/11/19/).

Here's the process :
 - selected [the right-to-left gif](https://neil.fraser.name/news/2007/RL.gif)
 - rescaled it to 128x128 and extracted all the frames using [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)
 - used [Unity's VFX Toolbox Image Sequencer](https://forum.unity.com/threads/release-thread-vfx-toolbox-image-sequencer.438465/) to resample the frames count and lay them on an images sheet
 ![Images sheet](https://i.imgur.com/hJvhZ78.jpg)
 - used a custom tool to build a Texture3D (basically create a Texture3D with the correct size then copy the images from the sheet as slices) from this sheet and save it as an asset
